Hello Kissi,

Because I didn't added any library with pod or carthage, you just need to open the project and run on a device.
The project just need a valid Bundle Identifier and a Team from your developer account.

A video demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RG-mJVSLwU)

Build on Xcode 8.3.3
